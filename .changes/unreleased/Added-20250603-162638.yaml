  Unbundle the SDK interface to support partial implementation.

  When you implement a custom SDK, you can now choose to just implement part of the `SDK` interface depending on your needs.
  That means:
  - `dagger develop` no longer fails if your SDK just implement the `Runtime` interface, it will simply not call `Codegen` if not defined.
  - `dagger call` and `dagger functions` give a clear error message if it's not supported by the SDK.

  See https://github.com/dagger/dagger/issues/7707 for more information.
