# Runtime

Multiple runtimes support TypeScript such as [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en), [Deno](https://deno.com/) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

By default, the TypeScript SDK executes functions using the NodeJS runtime but you can configure a different runtime in the `package.json`.

:::note
For now, the TypeScript SDK only supports NodeJS and Bun.
:::

To change the Typescript SDK runtime, set the field `dagger.runtime` in the `package.json`.

## Node  

Set the field to `node` to use the `NodeJS` runtime, it's also the default runtime used if this field is ommited.

```json
  "dagger": {
    "runtime": "node"
  }
```

## Bun 

Set the field to `bun` to use the Bun runtime.

```json
  "dagger": {
    "runtime": "bun"
  }
```

:::warning
The Bun runtime support is still experimental, Dagger cannot guarantee the perfect execution of the function until
Bun is fully compatible with Node.
