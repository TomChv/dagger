# Runtimes

Multiple runtimes support TypeScript such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Deno](https://deno.com/) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

By default, the TypeScript SDK executes functions using the Node.js runtime, but you can configure an alternative runtime in the `package.json` file.

:::note
For now, the TypeScript SDK only supports Node.js (stable) and Bun (experimental).
:::

To change the TypeScript SDK runtime, set the field `dagger.runtime` in the `package.json` file.

## Node  

Set the field to `node` to use the Node.js runtime. Node.js is also the default runtime used if this field is omitted.

```json
  "dagger": {
    "runtime": "node"
  }
```

## Bun 

Set the field to `bun` to use the Bun runtime.

```json
  "dagger": {
    "runtime": "bun"
  }
```

:::warning
Bun runtime support is still experimental. Unexpected results may occur in some cases.
