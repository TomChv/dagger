  Detect field `packageManager` in `package.json` to use it during the runtime.
  If the field is not present, the runtime will try to detect it from the lock file.
  By default, the runtime will use yarn@v1.22.0.

  Improving the SDK runtime to generate a lockfile based on the package manager.

  Improving the setup by moving dependencies installation to the `ModuleRuntime` function,
  which should improve performances during init & updates.

  Add caches folder mount for npm, yarn, pnpm & bun.
