  Bundle the Typescript SDK library instead of coping the whole module.

  This improves:
  - Maintainability: less files are generated.
  - Dependency management: The SDK already bundles all dependencies, so only user's specific one used in the module will be downloaded.
  - Performances: see benchmark: https://github.com/dagger/dagger/pull/10094#issuecomment-2786296756

  Transition to the bundle SDK is done automatically on the next `dagger develop` so it's not a breaking change.
